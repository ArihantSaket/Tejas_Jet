        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The HAL Tejas is an Indian multirole light fighter designed by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) in collaboration with Aircraft Research and Design Centre (ARDC) of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Indian Air Force and Indian Navy. It came from the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) programme, which began in the 1980s to replace India's ageing MiG-21 fighters but later became part of a general fleet modernisation programme. In 2003, the LCA was officially named "Tejas". It is the smallest and lightest in its class of contemporary supersonic combat aircraft.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Former Director of ADA and Project Director of LCA programme, Commodore CD Balaji (Retd), who is widely regarded as one of the main architects of the LCA programme said, “Actually in 1983, the government decided to set up ADA with a small team to find out whether India can build and develop an indigenous aircraft or not? Dr Kota Harinarayana was heading that group and that is how it was started. However, the final Cabinet approval for full-scale design and development of Tejas prototypes was given in 1993 – 10 years down the line. That is the actual start point of the programme formally. It was not 1983 but 1993 was the base year for the journey”.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Dr S Radhakrishnan, who was then the Director, Directorate of Industrial Interface and Technology Management, DRDO fondly recalls, “Bahrain was a historic event not only because LCA left the shores of India for the first time and was flown in full view of an international audience and the global media, but because ‘Tejas presence called the Pakistani bluff when they withdrew the JF-17 Thunder fighter produced with Chinese from the aero show.  They didn’t want to be compared with our LCA in terms of performance. They decided to pull back by paying a huge penalty to the Bahrain authorities for not turning up. It was a huge victory for our LCA because Tejas was far better than the Chinese JF-17; not only in performance but in every aspect.”</p>
